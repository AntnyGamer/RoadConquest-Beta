# Road Conquest 1.0 Beta 20

Road Conquest remembers the roads you drive and the places you visit, revealing them through a
cloud-textured fog map.

## Install

Android 12 or newer is required. Download the signed APK from Releases for direct installation.
For Google Play, download the **signed** `RoadConquest-<version>.aab` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AntnyGamer/RoadConquest-Beta/releases) page, not the unsigned intermediate from GitHub Actions. The Actions artifact is named `android-build-inputs-unsigned` and contains `app-release-UNSIGNED-DO-NOT-UPLOAD.aab`, which Google Play cannot accept. Each release also includes the Android Studio project and SHA-256 checksums.

If Play still reports an invalid signature for the **signed release** bundle, compare the SHA-256 fingerprint under Play Console → Test and release → App integrity → **Upload key certificate** (not the separate Google Play **App signing key certificate**) with the release upload key:

`CD:3C:4B:18:0B:47:40:A0:BF:F7:7E:37:DE:10:9B:E6:CA:B2:64:CD:1B:D6:6E:0C:ED:05:44:12:52:AD:9A:E1`

If these fingerprints differ, use the previously registered upload key or request an upload-key reset in Play Console. Do not generate a new keystore for an existing app or put signing keys in Git.

Grant Precise location. For automatic background tracking, choose Allow all the time in Android's
location settings and allow background battery use. Settings includes shortcuts to the relevant
Android screens. Allow notifications to see the tracking notification and its Stop tracking control.

This release uses Android application ID `com.roadconquest.app` and internal version code 46.
The app shows its exact version in Settings → About. Treat the application ID as permanent once
the Google Play listing is created; changing it later would create a different app.

## Explore

- Recorded driving appears while matching is pending; confirmed road geometry then refines it.
- Drive to save matched road lines and reveal the map. Accurate locations also reveal nearby
  places while walking or stopped, without adding driving miles.
- Earn points from newly unlocked roads, achievements and first visits to towns, states/regions
  and countries. Your current point balance is visible directly on the map.
- Open Garage & Shop to buy and equip car shapes, car colors, road colors, or the Golden
  Road Conquest UI and launcher icon. Purchases are one-time and equipped cosmetics can be changed later.
- Choose Streets, Minimal, Night or Satellite maps, and a Light, Dark or phone-controlled appearance.
- Use the map overlay button to highlight explored countries in blue, states/regions in purple, or towns in green. Only one overlay type is active at a time; tap a highlighted area for population and area when available.
- Tap an unlocked road for its name, saved length, first-unlocked time, last-driven time and times driven.
- Browse achievements by **Road Conquest**, **Mileage**, **Exploration**, **Ad Rewards**, and **Bonus** categories. Battery challenges live under Bonus; ad milestones have their own Ad Rewards category.
  Optional rewarded ads in the Garage grant the displayed points only after confirmed completion, and count toward ad milestones.
- Use automatic tracking or control it manually. Stop tracking from the foreground notification.
- Export driving history, road geometry, explored places, place discoveries, point awards,
  purchases and progression counters from Settings.
- Create an optional account, change your username and manage leaderboard visibility. There are exactly two destructive account/data actions in the app: Account → Delete account removes the cloud account while keeping saved device history and requires the current account password; Settings → Data and privacy → Delete all data removes all local Road Conquest data while keeping the cloud account and leaderboard scores and requires typing the exact local confirmation phrase. Local full-data deletion works while signed out, stops tracking, disables verified-drive sharing and removes private interrupted-export snapshots.

Map drawing and viewport refresh timers stop while the map activity is hidden. Returning reloads
roads changed during background tracking; GPS sampling and saved driving history are unaffected.

Turning Show fog off changes only its visibility. Tracking continues and the saved reveals return
when fog is enabled again. Manual tracking stays off until you enable it. On Android 12-13,
automatic mode can keep its foreground service ready while Android Location is off. Android 14+
requires system Location to be enabled before a location foreground service can start; while the
app is open, Road Conquest starts tracking as soon as Location is enabled. If a reboot happens with
Location off on Android 14+, enable Location and open Road Conquest to restart tracking. After a
fresh install or device-data reset, the first good live fix defines the zero-point starting
town/state/country and awards no discovery points. Cached fixes from before the new location request
cannot become that baseline. Automatic tracking still depends on location permissions and Android's
background-execution rules; a force-stopped app must be opened manually before it can resume.

Mileage estimates distance between accepted driving fixes, including repeat drives. GPS speed is
a heuristic and cannot prove you are in a car. Long gaps, reversed timestamps and implausible jumps
are excluded. Local road totals use a human-road identity layer: signed route refs from the existing
OSRM match response take priority, connected same-name fragments are joined, nearby divided
carriageways with the same route ref are treated as one road, and anonymous on/off ramps do not
inflate the count. Distant same-name or same-ref roads remain separate unless driven geometry
establishes a local connection. The counter is intentionally human-oriented rather than a raw
OSM-way or matcher-fragment count.

## Accounts and leaderboards

The app defaults to the existing live HTTPS account service. Usernames are unique without regard
to capitalization. Passwords are salted and scrypt-hashed on the server; Android stores an encrypted
session token. Local exploration does not require an account.

Account availability and competitive scoring are separate. Verified leaderboard credit requires
the production Play Integrity credentials and a pinned private road matcher/catalog. Until those
are configured, the leaderboard reports verification as unavailable and does not rank local totals.
Competitive roads count distinct OSM way sections, rather than whole named streets.

Leaderboard visibility and live GPS sharing are separate settings. New accounts can be visible on
leaderboards, but verified-drive GPS sharing remains off until the user explicitly enables it in Settings.
Deleting an account revokes its sessions and removes its cloud competitive data while leaving
saved device history in place. Deleting device data also disables verified-drive
GPS sharing before tracking shuts down, so queued evidence is not submitted afterward. Other devices
and user-saved exported files are separate.

Moving GPS gaps longer than 30 seconds start a new matching interval; nearby stationary pauses can
still reconnect without inventing a route across a location outage.

The fog keeps a cached world layer ready during fast gestures and refreshes detailed reveals
while the camera moves. A detailed reveal stays visible during a gesture while its georeferenced
bitmap still covers the viewport, avoiding the old flash back to fully covered fog. The widest zoom
accounts for the screen diagonal and camera latitude so rotation keeps the map inside its world edges.

Place discovery is intentionally sparse: background tracking records only an occasional local
candidate, while town/state/country names are resolved later on a foreground worker through
Android's system geocoder. Point refreshes use aggregate database queries, Shop/Settings avoid
duplicate launch refreshes, and map cosmetics are only regenerated when their selection changes.
These choices keep the progression system from adding continuous background network or rendering work.

## Build and verify

Open the project in Android Studio with JDK 21 or newer, Android SDK 37.0 and Build Tools 36.0.0.
The wrapper pins Gradle 9.6.1 with a verified checksum and Android Gradle Plugin 9.4.1.

```sh
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug :app:lintRelease :app:assembleDebug :app:assembleRelease :app:bundleRelease
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat` with the same tasks. The debug APK is
`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Local release builds are unsigned until signed with
the permanent release key. Signing keys, local SDK paths, databases and build outputs are excluded
from Git.

GitHub Actions runs account/database tests, Android unit tests, debug and release lint, and native
map integration tests on Android 12, 15 and 17. The release job publishes the verified signed APK and Play-ready signed AAB only after
all required jobs pass and only when that version tag does not already exist; ordinary commits at an
already-published version are verified without retargeting or overwriting the release. It also attaches the exact account-function bundle produced by the tested
backend job, so the deployable server artifact for that release is preserved alongside the Android release artifacts. It verifies the permanent signing-certificate digest and includes the source
ZIP and checksums for the APK, AAB, source archive and server bundle. Beta 17 is published from
`perf/battery-and-rendering-review` without merging the optimization PR. Release publication from
that branch is restricted to Beta 17; normal release publication continues from `main`.
Configure these repository secrets from the private signing backup:

- `ROADCONQUEST_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
- `ROADCONQUEST_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ROADCONQUEST_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`
- `ROADCONQUEST_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`

Keep the signing backup outside the repository and release assets. Each release needs a new
`versionName` and increasing `versionCode`; two-part and three-part release versions are supported.

Override the account endpoint with the Gradle property
`ROADCONQUEST_ACCOUNT_API_URL=https://accounts.example.com`. Local matching defaults to the public
OSRM demo; a compatible controlled matcher can be selected with
`ROADCONQUEST_OSRM_API_URL=https://roads.example.com`. Administrative overlay boundaries are requested only after the user enables an overlay; results are cached and requests are throttled. The APK reads the active provider from `OVERLAY_PROVIDER.txt` on this repository’s `main` branch so the service can be switched or disabled without an app update. Custom builds can point at another remote config with `ROADCONQUEST_PLACE_OVERLAY_CONFIG_URL=https://example.com/overlay-provider.txt`.
See [server setup](server/README.md) and the [physical-device checklist](ANDROID_TEST_CHECKLIST.md).

## Google Play submission

The release bundle targets API 37, uses application ID `com.roadconquest.app`, and is signed for Play upload. GitHub validates the original Gradle-built AAB with Google's `bundletool` before publishing; unlike previous versions, it does not modify the AAB to embed MapLibre native debugging symbols. The release still includes the full native-symbol ZIP, which should be uploaded separately in Play Console under the version's Downloads → Assets. ProGuard/R8 mapping metadata remains embedded.
CI verifies 16 KB native-library packaging/alignment before publication, in addition to unit tests, lint,
release builds, account-server tests, and native map tests on supported Android generations.
The account service exposes browser pages at `/privacy` and `/delete-account`. The app links the privacy policy from
Settings; keep the deletion page publicly reachable for the Play Console account-deletion field without adding a third in-app delete action. The first Android location permission flow is preceded by a prominent disclosure
covering precise location, background use, road matching, and optional verified scoring.

Play Console still requires the publisher to complete the Data safety form, background-location declaration,
developer/package registration, store listing assets, review access where applicable, and the other account-level
declarations that cannot be supplied by source code alone.

## Beta 20 Play bundle packaging and size

Beta 19's AAB was reported by Play Console as having an invalid signature even though
`jarsigner` verified it. The exact Play-side cause is not confirmed. As a conservative
repair, Beta 20 no longer alters Gradle's AAB after building it. MapLibre's full native
symbols remain available as a separate ZIP in GitHub Releases instead of being embedded
in the AAB; this significantly reduces the upload artifact size while preserving the
same runtime app. Google's `bundletool` validates both unsigned and signed bundles
before publication. ZIP directory entries are valid AAB content and were not a proven
cause of the rejection.

For full native crash symbolication, manually upload
`RoadConquest-1.0-beta.20-native-debug-symbols.zip` to Play Console's
**Test and release → App bundle explorer → Downloads → Assets** for this version.
This is separate from the AAB itself and is not installed on users' devices.
Reducing the symbols themselves using SYMBOL_TABLE/strip-debug would sacrifice
source-file and line-number information; Beta 20 keeps the full symbols.

## Beta 19 startup hotfix

Beta 18's minified release crashed before the main screen: R8 removed the public no-argument
constructor used by Room to create AdMob's WorkManager database. Beta 19 preserves that constructor.
Publication now also requires two cold launches of the minified release APK on Android 12 and 17,
using the exact unsigned APK produced by the release build before permanent signing. Install the
signed Beta 19 APK as an update to retain local driving history; do not uninstall or clear storage.

## Ads

AdMob anchored adaptive banners appear in separate footers on Garage, Achievements, Leaderboards,
and Settings. The driving map and account forms remain clear. No automatic full-screen ads are used.
Banners pause while their screen is hidden and are destroyed with it. Rewarded ads load only after
pressing **Load rewarded ad** in the Garage; **Watch ad** shows the exact point reward configured in
AdMob before playback. The SDK-confirmed reward is persisted once, together with the completed-view
counter; callbacks from a deleted history session are rejected. There is no automatic rewarded-ad
preloading or retry loop. These local points do not add verified leaderboard credit.

Release builds use the publisher's AdMob App ID and banner/rewarded units in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
Debug builds use Google's demo App ID and ad units; use debug builds for testing to avoid invalid
traffic on live ads. Google UMP updates consent on entry to an ad-supported screen and gates SDK
initialization/loading through `canRequestAds()`. Applicable **Ad privacy choices** stay reachable
in the footer even if no banner fills. Ads require a network connection and eligible inventory;
ad failures never block the rest of the screen.

Before distributing live ads, publish the appropriate messages in AdMob **Privacy & messaging**,
complete AdMob app/store verification and readiness review, and declare ads and the SDK's data
collection in Play Console. Deploy the updated account-service bundle so `/privacy` includes the
advertising disclosure, and allow version code 46 for verified scoring. GitHub release publication
builds and attaches that bundle; it does not deploy the account service or change AdMob/Play settings.
Ad requests have their own network, memory, storage, and battery costs; this release retains the
Beta 17 map/tracking optimizations but does not claim ads have zero overhead.

## Privacy and map credits

Driving history, explored places, points and purchases stay on the phone. Road matching sends small
coordinate batches to the selected OSRM service. Town/state/country labels are requested through
Android's system geocoder only while Road Conquest is foregrounded; the geocoder implementation and
network behavior are supplied by the device. Pending data remains saved for retry after network or
matching failures. User-selected ZIP exports contain precise history, road geometry and progression data.

When enabled and available, verified scoring sends precise live GPS batches with Play Integrity
evidence for independent server matching. The server retains scores, short-lived receipt hashes,
and a timestamp plus one-way fingerprint for the last accepted boundary fix; it does not retain
complete route history. Saved local totals and old history are never accepted as competitive scores.

Street maps use OpenFreeMap, OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap contributors. Satellite imagery uses
Esri World Imagery and its credited providers. Map providers receive requests for the area you view.
Styles are bundled; tiles, sprites, fonts and imagery require network access or an existing cache.
Satellite detail varies by area.

Settings → Licenses and map credits contains the app license and provider notices. Third-party
styles, map data, imagery and dependencies retain their own licenses and service terms. See
[NOTICE](NOTICE) and the credits under `app/src/main/assets/`.
